# push_swap

Huge shoutout to Eperaita (https://github.com/Eperaita) for helping me understand the sorting algorithm

Also to Aamorin (https://github.com/anderamo) for finding Errors and the ft_asctoint function


This proyects goal is to sort a random amount of numbers given some instructions


To execute the program:

./push_swap "numbers" || ./push_swap "218 1283 123 293 192"

./push_swap numbers.  || ./push_swap 218 1283 123 293 192


The list of numbers cannot have duplicates and they cannot be in order.
The program will display the instructions used to sort the list followed by a newline.
